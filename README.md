# Pay calculator for UNC OASIS Workstudy position
Created as a personal tool for pay management, but fellow students working for OASIS as a Workstudy can use this calculator to determine the amount of financial aid allotment they have left based on current number of hours worked. Calculator also offers a rough recommended number of hours to work per week to get the max allotment possible.

## Instructions: 
Simply download the appropriate executable (Windows version coming soon!) and run it! Or feel free to download the script directly and compile if you'd like.

Note: Unix version is for both Linux and MacOS systems.

## TODO: 
- Compile on Windows (any adventurous souls can easily compile the script and dependencies to an executable file using packages like [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org))
